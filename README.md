<br>**Our Client:** The Primary Mission of the South Lake Tahoe Firefighter’s Foundation is to bolster firefighter health, safety, and wellness within our community. We’re dedicated to equipping our local heroes with the tools, training, and resources they need to respond to emergencies effectively while prioritizing their own well-being.  


**The Project:** Create a website for the South Lake Tahoe Firefighter Foundation that enables the admin user to easily update and modify select areas, such as news, events, and other key content. The site will also facilitate the distribution of information, including newsletters and announcements, and provide functionality for managing donations and processing orders through an integrated storefront.
